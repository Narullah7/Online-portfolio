        I am currently a graduate from Brunel University while studying BSc Mathematics. I am currently at sparta global, training to become a software engineer.<br><br>
        Studying mathematics at University, I have gained an deep interest in the IT industry especially software development, and due to this I have recently started an online e-learning course titled “Web developer”, I am making good progress and I am hoping to apply the skills I’ve learned with my numerical and analytical skills to overcome challenging and stimulating problems with the best solution which benefits everybody. I am especially interested in your company because I believe I have the personal qualities and skills needed to succeed in this role i.e. strong desire to solve problems, good communication skills due to work experience. I am aware that I have no experience, however I am willing to work hard and improve every day to be able to succeed in the role. I believe I will contribute to the company by being a valuable and core member of the team and I would greatly appreciate becoming a part of your present and future team.<br><br>
        During my time at university, I have had many opportunities to develop further skills through assignments and group projects. A few of these skills was the ability to quickly grasp a new software and use it appropriately to get the correct results and teamwork, as a group we had to analyse GDP and compare this with birth rates in developed and developing countries using a statistical program SPSS, we were each given different components of the program to study the topic. I was given correlation, we also had to produce a report accurately displaying our results with appropriate figures and tables.   Overall as a group, we achieved an A grade.
