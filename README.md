#Brief
###Welcome to my online portfolio.
On the first page you have my homepage this does a basic introduction to myself.
As you scroll down, you come down to my "About me" page, this describes in more detail about my backstory i.e. my education and interests.
In my third page, you can see my skills and experiences, also what I have been working on and my competencies up-to-date.
In my last page I have my contact details, in case you would like to discuss my profile further.

#Difficulties
Some of the Difficulties I had when creating my online portfolio was after using the grid systems in HTML, I was no longer able to link my text to different parts of the webpage. I did research and could not find a solution.
Another problem was I didn't have enough time to fix my "contact me" page, I created round buttons but was unable to put text next to it. I have thought of a solution and would like to implement it as soon as possible.
I was also unable to complete my indentation and responsiveness because I ran out of time, however I believe that this is an achievable task and completed very quickly. I would like to do this as soon as possible.

#What Im pleased with
I am most pleased about being able to have a navigation stick to the top of the page while the user browses the webpage, I was especially happy with the way it was presented.
I was also happy with how my "experience page" turned out because it looks very professional and was very happy with the outcome of my page.
